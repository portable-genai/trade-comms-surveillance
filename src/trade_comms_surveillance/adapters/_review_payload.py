"""Shared conversion from an escalated result to an ``review-kit`` Review payload.

Lives in the adapter layer, not the pure domain, because it depends on the kit. The subject, the
summary and EVERY field of every citation (the locator and the title, not only the snippet) are
redacted BEFORE they leave the process (the same redact-before-anything rule the audit write
obeys), using the shared ``pii-kit``, so no raw identifier reaches Hrz7 over the wire; Hrz7
redacts again before its own audit write (defence in depth). ``maker`` and ``tenant`` are
asserted here and trusted by Hrz7 because the caller is an authenticated S2S service; per-hop
on-behalf-of token exchange is the deferred next layer.

    The case id is redacted ONCE and reused for the case reference and the idempotency key, so no
    raw identifier reaches the wire through a derived field. Neither may carry it RAW while
    ``subject`` and ``summary`` beside them were masked, which put the identifier on the shared
    console in exactly the two fields whose structural names made them look like keys rather than
    content. The intake path builds the case id as ``alert:<the alert subject>``, so it is client
    text: a case id should never carry personal data, but the redaction has to hold whether or
    not it does.

    The cost is named rather than hidden: two cases whose ids differ ONLY in a masked identifier
    now share a source key and collapse to one review at the console. That is the right trade
    against publishing a national identifier on a shared surface, and a case distinguished solely
    by a national id is not a case anyone should be keying on. The key stays stable across
    retries because the masking substitutes a fixed token per pattern, which
    ``test_the_idempotency_key_is_stable_across_retries`` checks rather than assumes.
