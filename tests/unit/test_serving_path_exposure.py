"""The loopback bound is a property of the APP OBJECT, not of ``main()``.

The defect this guards is invisible to a test that only calls ``main()`` or only reads
``resolve_bind_host``: the Dockerfile ``CMD`` and the Makefile ``run-api`` target serve the
``app`` object, so a bound that lives only in ``main()`` never runs in a shipped process.

The second half is the posture the app object is BUILT with, and it is the reason this file
re-imports the module under a scrubbed environment. An app assembled while the profile variable
is absent must not be indistinguishable from one assembled under a deliberate ``local``: same
CORS allowlist, same ``X-Dev-Persona`` header, same open S2S path, and, with an S2S token set,
an exposure guard switched OFF. That is a production deployment whose profile variable went
missing answering a stranger on the LAN with a seeded approver persona. Every route must refuse
instead, and "every" includes ``/healthz`` and the agent card: a deployment nobody configured
has no business being reachable at all.

The third half, and the reason the second was not enough: SETTING
``TRADECOMMS_S2S_TOKEN`` used to switch the guard off under a DELIBERATE
``local`` too, because the guard only ever covered the zero-secret demo. That is an ordinary
deployment shape, not a misconfiguration, and it served a LAN peer the seeded persona list and a
real triage decision. A service credential authenticates a calling SERVICE and no end user, so
the guard now reads the identity BINDING instead (see
``tests/unit/test_end_user_auth_posture.py`` for the derivation and its drift guard). Both
directions are proved below: the seeded-persona and unimplemented bindings refuse a LAN peer
whatever the token says, and a VERIFYING binding stands the guard down, which is the control
that keeps the first claim from being true for the boring reason.

The three-state resolution behind these postures is proved in
``tests/unit/test_profile_single_source.py``; here it is spent on real requests.
