"""Trade Comms Surveillance (Cmp1).

Post-trade market-abuse and trade-comms surveillance with cited, human-reviewed STOR cases.

A hexagonal ports-and-adapters build scaffolded from the catalog commons: a pure-stdlib domain
core, typed ports, swappable adapter profiles (local / gcp / onprem), a DI container driven by
one env var, and a green SDK-free offline gate. Identity, S2S, fail-closed defaults and the WORM
audit log come from ``hex-service-kit``; the eval scaffold from ``agent-eval-kit``; the PII pattern
pack from ``pii-kit``.
